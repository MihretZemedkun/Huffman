# Huffman
Huffman coding is a lossless compression algorithm that achieves
a very impressive rate of compression. It's a general method for finding the
optimal variable-length prefix-codes.
To run:
compile, run this Huff.java file, and you will get a "huffCodingResults.txt"
output with the result of the encoding algorithm.
